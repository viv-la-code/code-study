This is a repo for code problems and solutions for the unofficial Viv Labs, Inc. code study group. 

# Setup
I recommend you fork this repo and add it as a remote so you have your code preserved on your own github even should something happen to the main repository. 

## Forked setup (recommended)
1. Fork this repo
1. Clone your fork
1. Add the main repo as a remote (usually 'upstream')
1. Create a working (feature) branch named your github username
1. Push your clean working branch onto the main repo
1. Once you have new code committed, push your working branch to your fork
1. Create a pull request against your clean working branch on the main repo and merge your code (not required, but nice so we can all compare work and learn from each other!)

## Quick setup
1. Clone this repo
1. Create a working (feature) branch named your github username
1. Once you have new code committed, push your working branch to this repo (not required, but nice so we can all compare work and learn from each other!)


# How to use this repo
Each folder is a problem. The master branch will contain a problem description and blank code file. Please fork this repo, and pull any changes into a branch named your username on the main repo.

Example: 
My github is bradlm. So, any of my solutions should be merged into the bradlm branch of viv-la-code/code-study.
